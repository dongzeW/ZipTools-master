# ZipDownloader #

This is an example app for Android that shows how to implement a background task that will download a .zip file from an internet URL, then unzip the contents to a cache folder on external storage (a.k.a the SD card).

Often applications, such as games, which have a lot of image and audio assets need to perform a one-time download at first run of the application.  This is because Google enforces a 50-megabyte limit for Android APK downloads.  Additionally, some other use cases require downloading portions of an app immediately after installation.

The code is published under the MIT open-source license.

## About the code ##

### Classes ###

#### `com.jotabout.zipdownloader` package ####

`MainActivity`  

 * Main application UI.  Also contains background task for download.

#### `com.jotabout.zipdownloader.util` package ####

`DecompressZip`  

 * High-level wrapper to easily unzip files.

`DownloadFile`  

 * Utility methods to download a file from an internet URL.

`ExternalStorage`  

 * A wrapper class that answers the question, "Give me a place to put my stuff."

### Developer notes ###

The code:

* Traps errors and cleans up after itself in the event of error
* Performs all I/O operatons (network and filesystem) in the background, for StrictMode compliance
* Keeps the screen alive while the download is in process
* Locates the files on external storage in a place which will be automatically deleted by Android on uninstall
* Uses buffered I/O for efficiency
* Manages internal data in a way as to (mostly) be friendly to the Dalvik garbage collector.
* is compatible with all versions of Android 2.1 through 4.0

In short, it is production-ready code.
